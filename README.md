# Data Engineering Mini Project 2
## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to use the previous template and pandas to analyze a dataset, obtain its summary statistics and visualization. The dataset used here is the "cereal" dataset, which contains statistics of different cereal brands, including calories, ratings, weight, etc.

## Steps
1. Add python to requirement.txt
2. In main.py, define two functions. One returns the summary statistics and the other visualizes the data.
3. Add test cases in test_main.py. 

## Check format and test
Use make test command to test the code
